      <p class="hero-text">
        At LayerZero Innovations, we recognize that the most critical insights don’t just live on the surface—they are buried in the strata and forged over eons. Our platform, <strong>Lizo AI</strong>, redefines Geospatial Intelligence by synthesizing three distinct dimensions of data: <strong>Surface, Subsurface, and Deep Time.</strong>

        <h2>Why the Integration Matters</h2>
        <p>Most intelligence platforms provide a snapshot; we provide a narrative. This multidimensional approach allows us to solve complex, high-stakes problems.</p>
